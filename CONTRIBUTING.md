#### Public types

`@prismicio/client` exports public-facing types for Prismic models and REST API V2 responses. They will likely need to be modified when models are changed.

- Model types are written in `src/types/model`. Each field type (e.g. key text) or composite field type (e.g. shared slice) has its own file.
- REST API V2 types are written in `src/types/value`. Each field type (e.g. key text) or composite field type (e.g. shared slice) has its own file.
- Repository API values, like `/api/v2` and ref values, are written in `src/types/api`. These files generally do not need to be edited for model changes.
- Webhook API values are written in `src/types/webhook`. These files generally do not need to be edited for model changes.

#### Content helpers

- `@prismicio/client` provides helpers for manipulating Prismic content. For example, `asDate` converts a date field to a JavaScript `Date` instance.
- Helpers are located in `src/helpers` with one file per helper. Find helpers that are affected by your model changes and update them accordingly.
- If your model changes require a new helper, add it to the library. In general, wait for usage patterns to emerge from users before adding helpers. You donâ€™t want to write helpers that no one will use.

#### Tests

`@prismicio/client` has tests for its JavaScript/TypeScript API. It also has tests for its public TypeScript types.

##### JavaScript/TypeScript tests

- Any change to this library should be tested. A test can be as simple as ensuring a helper has the correct output.
- Tests should be placed in the `test` directory using the existing file name convention.
- Tests are written using Vitest.

##### TypeScript type tests

- Any change to this library should be tested. A test can be as simple as ensuring a type is compatible with a payload.
- Type tests should be placed in the `test/types` directory using the existing file name convention.
- Tests are written using `ts-expect` and run using `tsc`.
